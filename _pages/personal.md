This page contains more personal content, reflections and ideas. Please see the [main page](https://aleksispi.github.io) for my professional bio.

When not doing research, I enjoy spending time with my family (my wife, my 4-year-old, and my cairn terrier Yoshi). Some hobbies and interests I've had over the years include gym training (2009-2015; 2023 and onwards); board gaming (2013 and onwards); and small-scale food growing at home (2020 and onwards).
