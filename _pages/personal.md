This page contains more personal content, reflections and ideas. Please see the [main page](https://aleksispi.github.io) for my professional bio.

When not doing research, I enjoy spending time with my family (my wife, my 4-year-old, and my cairn terrier Yoshi). Some hobbies and interests I've had over the years include gym training (2009-2015; 2023 and onwards), board gaming (2013 and onwards), and tiny-scale farming at my ground-level apartment (2020 and onwards). Since the spring of 2020 (and with less intensity since 2018), I've also been deeply worried about the [multiple interlocking crises that our societies face](https://www.postcarbon.org/publications/welcome-to-the-great-unraveling/), which I aim to write more about here in the future. I also intend to write down / summarize ideas on the topic of [individual and community resilience](https://aleksispi.github.io/resilience).
