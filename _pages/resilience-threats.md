This is a more in-depth overview of [_Episode 8: Threat Modeling_](https://shows.acast.com/building-up-resilience/episodes/episode-8-threat-modeling)
of the podast [_Building Up: Resilience_](https://shows.acast.com/building-up-resilience) by Kory and Kellan (K&K). Please refer to [this overview page](https://aleksispi.github.io/resilience)
for a summary of the overall resilience framework proposed and discussed within this podcast.

Just like the step previous step _Consider your variables_, this step (_Threat modeling_) influences how one emphasizes the various pillars in the _Consider the pillars_ step, and is used to tackle the questions. This step is very related to the previous step about the variables, but here with an emphasis on the risk landscape. "_How will climate change affect my area?_", "_How is the political landscape?"_, "_How dependent is my region on energy / materials from other regions in the world?_, etcetera.

Just like for the _Consider your variables_ step, for this step it is also recommended to setup a spreadsheet or similar to go over various threats in a systematic way. A website called
[_The Prepared_](https://theprepared.com/) is mentioned by Kory early on in the episode, and some of the things from a [blog post on threat modeling](https://theprepared.com/forum/thread/an-introduction-to-threat-modeling/) from that page are mentioned in this episode:

The purpose of a threat model is to examine your preparedness by identifying **assets**, **threats**, **defenses**, and **vulnerabilities**. In short, the process answers the questions:

- “What am I preparing for?”
- “What do I have?”
- “How can I protect it?“ (also emphasized in the episode that it's important to be aware of "How am I unable to protect it?", i.e. to know what's in one's control)
- “What could go wrong?”
- “What am I missing, overlooking, or not seeing?”.

Kellan then chipped in an emphasized the importance of the previous steps in the resilience framework, e.g. that each individual's variables (see previous step) will very much influence this threat modeling step.
