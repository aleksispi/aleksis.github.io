This is a more in-depth overview of [_Episode 8: Threat Modeling_](https://shows.acast.com/building-up-resilience/episodes/episode-8-threat-modeling)
of the podast [_Building Up: Resilience_](https://shows.acast.com/building-up-resilience) by Kory and Kellan (K&K). Please refer to [this overview page](https://aleksispi.github.io/resilience)
for a summary of the overall resilience framework proposed and discussed within this podcast.

Just like the step previous step _Consider your variables_, this step (_Threat modeling_) influences how one emphasizes the various pillars in the _Consider the pillars_ step, and is used to tackle the questions. This step is very related to the previous step about the variables, but here with an emphasis on the risk landscape. "_How will climate change affect my area?_", "_How is the political landscape?"_, "_How dependent is my region on energy / materials from other regions in the world?_, etcetera.
