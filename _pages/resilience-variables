This is a more in-depth overview of [_Episode 7: Consider Your Variables_](https://shows.acast.com/building-up-resilience/episodes/episode-7-consider-your-variables)
of the podast [_Building Up: Resilience_](https://shows.acast.com/building-up-resilience) by Kory and Kellan (K&K). Please refer to [this overview page](https://aleksispi.github.io/resilience)
for a summary of the overall resilience framework proposed and discussed within this podcast.

The step _Consider your variables_ influences how one emphasizes the various pillars in the previous step, and is used to tackle the questions _“How should I prepare?”_ and
_“What should I prepare for?”_. Questions such as _“How much time do I have to work on my resilience?”_, _“How much finances do I have for it?”_, _“What is my location (e.g. urban vs
rural area) and local circumstances?”_ will help guide this.

Within the episode, the following are the main variables to consider regarding the question _“How should I prepare?”_

- **How much time do I have?**
- **How much money do I have?** Split this into two parts: (1) Disposable income, and (2) Wealth (e.g. how much property do I own?). For example, one may have a low disposable income but still be in a 
good position if one own's property, versus somebody who has a large income but has to pay a lot in rent.
- **What is my location?** This question can be asked at two levels: (1) The geographical position in the world, and (2) How close one's location is to key resources etcetera. Note that
the amount of time and money devoted to different pillars may differ a lot depending on this (e.g. less focus on a backup heat source in a tropical climate).
- **What does my community / community type look like?** As in, am I in an urban / suburban / rural area?
- **What is my starting point?** As in, where am I within the "resilience spectrum" at the start of my journey towards increased resilience? Example questions: What resources do you have access to,
what skills do you know already, etcetera.
- **Am I an introvert or an extrovert?** Affects e.g. community building.
- **What's my family size, and who is / are going to be dependent on me?**
- **Who's in it with me?** For example, in a relationship it could be that your partner does not support / is not interested in anything resilience-related. This makes your path towards
resilience different compared to the case where your partner is on the same page as you.
- **What's my health status?**

Within the episode, the following are the main variables to consider regarding the question _“What should I prepare for?”_ Note that there is lots of cross-over with the corresponding
_“How should I prepare?”_ list.

- **What is my location?** This question can be asked at two levels: (1) The geographical position in the world (relates to _“What should I prepare for?”_), and (2) How close one's location
is to key resources etcetera (relates to _“How should I prepare?”_). Note that the amount of time and money devoted to different pillars may differ a lot depending on this (e.g. less focus
on a backup heat source in a tropical climate).

It is recommended to make a profile of oneself (about 21 minutes in), even writing it down, so that one can assess one's variables properly.
