On this page I'm providing short summaries of some of the episodes of the podcast [_Building Up: Resilience_](https://shows.acast.com/building-up-resilience) by Kory and Kellan (K&K). The podcast revolves around how to improve individual and community resilience (with an emphasis on the latter) in face of increasing disruption, uncertainty and breakdown (refer for example to K&K's previous podcast [_Breaking Down: Collapse_]([xx](https://collapsepod.buzzsprout.com/)) for more on the latter). Also note that this is not a "prepper" podcast, of which there exist many, so the focus of it is not the typical _"How do I survive as long as possible no matter what may come?"_ mentality. Rather, the the podcast carefully lays out a resilience framework which explicitly asks the listener to ask what is important to them.

In [Episode 3: _Principles_](https://shows.acast.com/building-up-resilience/episodes/episode-3-principles), K&K lay out the following principles for their resilience framework:

**Principle 1: Non-aggression.** Harm and violence shall not be enacted on others merely to fulfill ones needs (e.g. getting food or water). Self-defence is allowed.

**Principle 2: TODO.**
(The rest of the principles will be added.)
