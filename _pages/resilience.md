On this page I'm providing my own short summaries of some of the episodes of the podcast [_Building Up: Resilience_](https://shows.acast.com/building-up-resilience) by Kory and Kellan (K&K). The podcast revolves around how to improve individual and community resilience (with an emphasis on the latter) in face of increasing disruption, uncertainty and breakdown (refer for example to K&K's previous podcast [_Breaking Down: Collapse_]([xx](https://collapsepod.buzzsprout.com/)) for more on the latter). Also note that this is not a "prepper" podcast, of which there exist many, so the mentality of the show is **not** _"How do I survive as long as possible, at all costs, no matter what may come?"_ Rather, the podcast carefully lays out a resilience framework which explicitly asks the listener to ask what is important to them. In particular, note that many people may _not_ consider individual survival at all costs to be their true purpose.

In [Episode 3: _Principles_](https://shows.acast.com/building-up-resilience/episodes/episode-3-principles), K&K lay out the following principles for their resilience framework:

**Principle 1: Non-aggression.** Harm and violence shall not be enacted on others merely to fulfill the needs of oneself or of one's family or community (e.g. inflicting harm on others to get food or water). Self-defence is however allowed. I interpret this principle as being about non-aggression against _other humans_; I would assume the principle still allows for killing e.g. wild animals in order to eat them. Also, note that the principle of non-aggression essentially makes the "_at all costs_" part of the question _"How do I survive as long as possible, at all costs, no matter what may come?"_ irrelevant.

**Principle 2: Cooperation.** One cannot become truly resilient by only focusing on oneself; one has to also include a cooperation / community aspect to one's preparedness. Individual resilience is also important, but one should strive to build this "outwards" towards larger networks as well.

**Principle 3: Effort.** This principle provides guidance on how to think about effort when it comes to resilience and preparedness. **(1)** No effort that you put in is going to be wasted. **(2)** Any effort is better than no effort. **(3)** Everyone is somewhere on a "resilience spectrum"; we can never become "fully resilient" in an absolute sense, only move up or down the spectrum. **(4)** When at the low end of this resilience spectrum, small efforts can increase resilience very quickly (one can sort of think about it something like "20% of the work goes into moving from 0% to 80% resilience, while 80% of the work is required for the remaining 20%"). **(5)** Focus on what is in your control and what you aim for; you don't need to prepare for every possible scenario. Prioritize covering things based on risks that are relevant to you and your community, as well as your goals.

**Principle 4: Emotional and mental resilience.** When thinking about resilience and preparedness, many (most?) people first think about physical resilience (such as ensuring access to food, water, shelter, and so on). However, a robust emotional and mental resilience is crucial also for long-term physical resilience. One can think of it as the oxygen that keeps everything else going. Note that being mentally resilient does _not_ mean that one cannot simultaneously suffer from things such as mental health problems or anxiety. Rather, it's a mindset that revolves around various ways to cope with what may come, both from internal and external stresses.

**Principle 5: Quality trumps quantity.** A well thought-out, tailored 'resilience knapsack' is much better than a large but un-organized knapsack. Focus on what you need for your circumstances and goals. 

**Principle 6: Diversity and redundancy.** Don't put all your eggs into one basket. When storing food, for example, don't store _all_ your food in a single type of container (e.g. glass, since then an Earth quake would destroy your whole food supply, as opposed to if some of the food was stored in plastic containers). 

**Principle 7: Specialization vs generalization.** Our complex civilization has enabled an enormous amount of specialization among skills, types of work, and so on. It goes the other way around as well; this civilization is _dependent_ on this specialization among individuals, companies, nations etcetera. This all works as long as society remains somewhat stable, since commodoties, labour etcetera can be efficiently 'transfered' among various actors. The downside is that, as individuals, our specializations also make us vulnerable to crises, especially such crises which require us to be able to do more things ourselves (as opposed to outsourcing it to various specialists). The principle of specialization vs generalization recognizes the value of specialization (especially in combination with _Principle 2: Cooperation_, where a community can have individuals specializing in different things to create a good synergy), but emphasizes the importance of also trying to acquire a diverse set of skills, to become a bit of a jack-of-all-trades, in order to be more ready for a more turbulent and uncertain future. Note that this principle is somewhat similar to the previous _Principle 6: Diversity and redundancy_. I also think this principle has an interesting synergy with _Principle 5: Quality trumps quantity_. More specifically, I think that specializing in just a few _relevant_ skills can be the best way to go at times, rather than knowing a bit of everything.

**Principle 8: Adaptability.** One must be ready to change ones plans, no matter how well-crafted those planed seemed originally. This principle is related to some of the previous ones, e.g. _Principle 7: Specialization vs generalization_; being more of a generalist than a specialist makes it easier to be adaptable to whatever circumstances one my face. Note, however, that this principle does _not_ say one should not come up with plans, just that we must be able to adapt those plans depending on what comes our way.

Having laid out the principles above, in [Episode 4: _The Framework_](https://shows.acast.com/building-up-resilience/episodes/episode-4-the-framework), the overall resilience framework is introduced (**I plan to write more about these in the near future**; for now I just list them below):

**(1) Establish a desired outcome.** This is discussed in detail in [_Episode 5_](https://shows.acast.com/building-up-resilience/episodes/episode-5-establish-your-desired-outcome).

**(2) Consider the pillars.**

**(3) Consider the variables.**

**(4) Thread modeling.**

**(5) Create a plan of action.**

**(6) Gain knowledge, skills and asses.**

**(7) Build community.**
