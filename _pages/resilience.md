On this page I'm providing my own short summaries of some of the episodes of the podcast [_Building Up: Resilience_](https://shows.acast.com/building-up-resilience) by Kory and Kellan (K&K). The podcast revolves around how to improve individual and community resilience (with an emphasis on the latter) in face of increasing disruption, uncertainty and breakdown (refer for example to K&K's previous podcast [_Breaking Down: Collapse_]([xx](https://collapsepod.buzzsprout.com/)) for more on the latter). Also note that this is not a "prepper" podcast, of which there exist many, so the mentality of the show is **not** _"How do I survive as long as possible no matter what may come?"_ Rather, the the podcast carefully lays out a resilience framework which explicitly asks the listener to ask what is important to them.

In [Episode 3: _Principles_](https://shows.acast.com/building-up-resilience/episodes/episode-3-principles), K&K lay out the following principles for their resilience framework:

**Principle 1: Non-aggression.** Harm and violence shall not be enacted on others merely to fulfill the needs of oneself or of one's family or community (e.g. inflicting harm on others to get food or water). Self-defence is however allowed. _My own comment:_ I interpret this principle as being about non-aggression against _other humans_; I would assume the principle still allows for killing e.g. wild animals in order to eat them, in case one would starve otherwise.

**Principle 2: Cooperation.** One cannot become truly resilient by only focusing on oneself; one has to also include a cooperation / community aspect to one's preparedness. Individual resilience is also important, but one should strive to build this "outwards" towards larger networks as well.

**Principle 3: Effort.** This principle provides guidance on how to think about effort when it comes to resilience and preparedness. (1) No effort that you put in is going to be wasted. (2) Any effort is better than no effort. (3) Everyone is somewhere on a "resilience spectrum"; we can never become "fully resilient" in an absolute sense, only move up or down the spectrum. (4) When at the low end of this resilience spectrum, small efforts can increase resilience very quickly (one can sort of think about it something like "20% of the work goes into moving from 0% to 80% resilience, while 80% of the work is required for the remaining 20%"). (5) Focus on what is in your control and what you aim for; you Don't need to prepare for every possible scenario. Prioritize covering things based on risks that are relevant to you and your community, as well as your goals.

**Principle 4: Emotional and mental resilience.** When thinking about resilience and preparedness, many (most?) first think about physical resilience (such as ensuring access to food, water, shelter, and so on).

(The rest of the principles will be added.)
