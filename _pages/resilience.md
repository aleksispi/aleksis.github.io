On this page I'm providing short summaries of some of the episodes of the podcast [_Building Up: Resilience_](https://shows.acast.com/building-up-resilience) by Kory and Kellan. The podcast revolves around how to improve individual and community resilience (with an emphasis on the latter) in face of increasing disruption, uncertainty and breakdown (refer for example to Kory and Kellan's previous podcast [_Breaking Down: Collapse_]([xx](https://collapsepod.buzzsprout.com/)) for more on the latter). Also note that this is not a "prepper" podcast, of which there exist many, so the focus of it is not the typical _"How do I survive as long as possible no matter what may come?"_ mentality. Rather, the the podcast carefully lays out a resilience framework which explicitly asks the listener to ask what is important to them.
