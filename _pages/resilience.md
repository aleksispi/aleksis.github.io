On this page I'm providing short summaries of some of the episodes of the podcast [_Building Up: Resilience_](https://shows.acast.com/building-up-resilience) by Kory and Kellan (K&K). The podcast revolves around how to improve individual and community resilience (with an emphasis on the latter) in face of increasing disruption, uncertainty and breakdown (refer for example to K&K's previous podcast [_Breaking Down: Collapse_]([xx](https://collapsepod.buzzsprout.com/)) for more on the latter). Also note that this is not a "prepper" podcast, of which there exist many, so the focus of it is not the typical _"How do I survive as long as possible no matter what may come?"_ mentality. Rather, the the podcast carefully lays out a resilience framework which explicitly asks the listener to ask what is important to them.

In [Episode 3: _Principles_](https://shows.acast.com/building-up-resilience/episodes/episode-3-principles), K&K lay out the following principles for their resilience framework:

**Principle 1: Non-aggression.** Harm and violence shall not be enacted on others merely to fulfill ones needs (e.g. getting food or water). Self-defence is allowed.

**Principle 2: Cooperation.** One cannot become as resilient by only focusing on oneself compared to also including a cooperation / community aspect to it (individual resilience also important, but should build this "outwards" towards larger networks as well.

**Principle 2: Effort.** (1) No effort that you put in is going to be wasted; any effort is better than no effort. (2) We are already somewhere on a "resilience spectrum", we can never become "resilient" in an absolute sense, only move up or down the spectrum. (3) When at the low end of the resilience spectrum, small efforts can increase resilience very quickly (think "20% of the work is to reach from 0 to 80% resilience; 80% work is required for the remaining 20%"). (4) Don't need to prepare for every possible scenario; first cover things based on risks and your goals.

(The rest of the principles will be added.)
