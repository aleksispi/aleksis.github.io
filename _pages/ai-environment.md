This page contains information about projects, publications and other things that relate specifically to my work on and passion for developing ML systems for various environmental applications. It is thus in a sense a subset of my full professional bio which can be found on the [main page](https://aleksispi.github.io).

## Media and public communication

**September 2022:** [AI for climate (Naturvetarna podcast, in Swedish)](https://www.naturvetarna.se/om-oss/naturvetarpodden/aleksis-pirinen--kan-ai-losa-klimatkrisen/) -- [Extended conversation (video)](https://youtu.be/p1AT31S37b4)

**May 2022:** Keynote presentation about AI for tackling the climate challenges at _Stockholm Tech_, Kista.

**January 2022:** [AI and climate change (RISE Learning Machines)](https://youtu.be/QXztQfKLiSc) -- [Article about the talk](https://www.ri.se/en/ai-center/aleksis-pirinen-we-must-dare-to-discuss-pessimistic-scenarios)

## Other past and ongoing projects

**2023 (ongoing):** [ML for cloud optical thickness prediction](https://www.ai.se/en/node/81535/national-space-data-lab-20) together with the [Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI)](https://www.smhi.se/en/about-smhi/who-we-are/who-we-are-1.83748), [AI Sweden](https://www.ai.se/en), [Luleå University of Technology](https://www.ltu.se/?l=en) and the [Swedish Forestry Agency](https://www.skogsstyrelsen.se/). Poster will be presented at [EUMETSTAT 2023](https://www.eumetsat.int/eumetsat-meteorological-satellite-conference-2023). The final cloud prediction models will be integrated with the [Digital Earth Sweden platform](https://digitalearth.se/). Funded by [Vinnova](https://www.vinnova.se/en/).

**Fall 2022:** [Pre-study about using ML for wetland monitoring in Sweden](https://www.naturvardsverket.se/om-oss/aktuellt/nyheter-och-pressmeddelanden/ai-teknik-testas-for-att-identifiera-vatmarker/) together with and funded by the [Swedish Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.naturvardsverket.se/en/). Code is available [here](https://github.com/aleksispi/ai-swetlands).

## Past and ongoing supervision

**Summer 2023 (ongoing):** Co-main supervisor (jointly with [Dr. Olof Mogren](mogren.one)) of the master thesis students Axel Eiman and Nils Eickhoff, Chalmers University of Technology. Thesis (preliminary title): _Deep learning for detecting coffee berry diseases_. The thesis topic is within the area of climate adaptation and is conducted with collaborators in Tanzania, who provide data and use-cases.

**Spring 2023 (ongoing):** Main supervisor of the master thesis student Ennio Rampello, KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Academic supervisors: [Prof. Yifang Ban](https://www.kth.se/profile/yifang) and [Dr. Puzhao Zhang](https://www.kth.se/profile/puzhao). Thesis (preliminary title): _High-altitude navigation for the AiRLoc model: An RL model for drone navigation_. The thesis is related to the area of UAV-based disaster response and management.

**Spring 2023 (ongoing):** Main supervisor of the master thesis student Vishal Nedungadi, KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Academic supervisors: [Prof. Yifang Ban](https://www.kth.se/profile/yifang)  and [Ritu Yadav (PhD candidate)](https://www.kth.se/profile/rituy). Thesis (preliminary title): _Active street to aerial view
geo-localization_. The thesis is related to the area of UAV-based disaster response and management.

**Spring 2022:** Main supervisor of the master thesis students Anton Samuelsson and John Backsund, Lund University. Academic supervisor: [Prof. Kalle Åström](https://www.maths.lu.se/staff/kalleastrom/). Thesis: [Aerial View Goal Localization with Reinforcement Learning](https://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&recordOId=9088977&fileOId=9089013). The thesis was subsequently condensed and accepted to a remote sensing workshop at ICLR 2023 (see _Publications and preprints_ above). The thesis is related to the area of UAV-based disaster response and management.

## Review work
I have served as a reviewer for the ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (2023).
