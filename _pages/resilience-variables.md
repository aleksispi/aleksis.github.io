This is a more in-depth overview of the third step of a resilience framework proposed and described in the podast [_Building Up: Resilience_](https://shows.acast.com/building-up-resilience) by Kory and Kellan (K&K). This step is described in [_Episode 7: Consider Your Variables_](https://shows.acast.com/building-up-resilience/episodes/episode-7-consider-your-variables). Please refer to [this overview page](https://aleksispi.github.io/resilience) for a summary of the overall resilience framework, and on [this page](https://aleksispi.github.io/resilience-threats/) you can see my more in-depth overview of the next (fourth) step of the framework.

The step _Consider your variables_ influences how one emphasizes the various pillars in the previous _Consider the pillars_ step, and is used to tackle the questions _“How should I prepare?”_ and _“What should I prepare for?”_. Questions such as _“How much time do I have to work on my resilience?”_, _“How much finances do I have for it?”_, _“What is my location (e.g. urban vs
rural area) and local circumstances?”_ will help guide this.

Within the episode, the following are said to be some of the main variables to consider regarding the question _“How should I prepare?”_

- **How much time do I have?**
- **How much money do I have?** Split this into two parts: (1) Disposable income, and (2) Wealth (e.g. how much property do I own?). For example, one may have a low disposable income but still be in a good position if one owns property, versus somebody who has a large income but has to pay a lot in rent.
- **What is available at my location?** Refers e.g. to how close one's geographical location is to key resources etcetera. For example, if one has a river nearby, the how-to-prepare aspect
when it comes to water availability differs from the case when there are no nearby water sources.
- **What does my community / community type look like?** As in, am I in an urban / suburban / rural area?
- **What is my starting point?** As in, where am I within the "resilience spectrum" at the start of my journey towards increased resilience? Example questions: What resources do you have access to,
what skills do you know already, etcetera.
- **Am I an introvert or an extrovert?** Affects e.g. community building.
- **What's my family size, and who is / are going to be dependent on me?**
- **Who's in it with me?** For example, in a relationship it could be that your partner does not support / is not interested in anything resilience-related. This makes your path towards
resilience different compared to the case where your partner is on the same page as you.
- **What's my health status?**

The following are said to be the some of the main variables to consider regarding the question _“What should I prepare for?”_ Note that there is lots of cross-over with the corresponding
_“How should I prepare?”_ list, even though the questions in the respective categories have different implications (compare e.g. the respective locality-related questions _"What is available
at my location?"_ versus _"What is my geographical location?"_).

- **What is my geographical location?** Note that the amount of time and money devoted to different pillars may differ a lot depending on this (e.g. less focus
on a backup heat source in a tropical climate).
- **What does my community / community type look like?** As in, am I in an urban / suburban / rural area?
- **What are my community ties?** As in, am I in a political group, religious organization, etc?
- **What is my rough age?** This affects what you prepare for, because you may think that certain threats only become present in X years, while you may no longer be alive (due to age) after
that many years.
- **What is my gender?**
- **What is my health status?**
- **What is my family size?**
- **What is my minority status?** Minorities often become scapegoats in times of crises / scarcity.
- **What is my end goal?** Ties right back to the first step _Establish your desired outcome_.
- **What are my current interests and skillsets?**

It is also mentioned that it is recommended to make a profile of oneself, even writing it down, so that one can assess one's variables properly.
