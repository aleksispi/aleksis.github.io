I'm currently a senior machine learning researcher at [RISE Research Institutes of Sweden](https://www.ri.se/sv/person/aleksis-pirinen) within the [deep learning research group](http://mogren.one/group/), where my main research interest is to develop [ML methods for a broad range of environmental applications](https://aleksispi.github.io/ai-environment/) (e.g. climate adaptation and humanitarian aid causes).

Before joining [RISE](https://www.ri.se/en), I conducted my doctoral studies in computer vision at the [Faculty of Engineering, Lund University](https://www.lth.se/english/), under the supervision of [Prof. Cristian Sminchisescu](https://www.maths.lth.se/sminchisescu/). In my research, I applied deep reinforcement learning to computer vision tasks such as object detection and active vision, with the aim of making visual recognition systems more flexible and adaptive. My work also involved teaching assistance at both graduate and undergraduate courses at Lund University. For example, I took a significant part in the development and teaching of a new machine learning course -- among other things, I taught several lectures on reinforcement learning. I successfully defended my PhD thesis [*Reinforcement Learning for Active Visual Perception*](https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/6065e35e-b97b-44b8-97b0-a04fe3862a13) in June, 2021.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I received a bachelor and master degree within engineering mathematics (in Swedish: Civilingenjör i teknisk matematik) from the Faculty of Engineering, Lund University. During this time, I spent a summer (2014) as a research intern at [California Institute of Technology](https://www.caltech.edu/) (Pasadena, USA), where I improved an algorithm for clustering, a fundamental problem in machine learning and statistics. I also strengthened some theoretical recovery guarantees. This work resulted in a [journal publication in JMLR](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v20/16-128.html). My supervisors were [Assoc. Prof. Brendan Ames](https://math.ua.edu/people/brendan-ames/) and [Prof. Joel Tropp](https://tropp.caltech.edu/).

I'm an advocate for facing our difficult future (and present, for many), collectively and individually, so that we can try to reduce harm and suffering. I may write more about this under my [personal page](https://aleksispi.github.io/personal/) at some point, but for anyone interested in learning more about what is difficult about our future, I warmly recommend the podcasts [_The Great Simplification_](https://www.thegreatsimplification.com/), [_Breaking Down: Collapse_](https://collapsepod.buzzsprout.com/) and [_Planet: Critical_](https://www.planetcritical.com/podcast). Two other short and self-contained podcasts that I also recommend are [_Power: Limits and Prospects for Human Survival_](https://power.postcarbon.org/podcast/) and [_Tipping Point: The True Story of "The Limits to Growth"_](https://tippingpointstory.podigee.io/).
